## Project Introduction

Sunrise Healthcare (Hospital Management system) is a simple low-cost SaaS offering intended for use by Patients and Health Providers in developing nations and emerging economies. The solution allows Patients to manage their health provider information and simple workflow such as scheduling visits. We deliver a Proof-of-Concept (POC) application with a MVP feature set consisting of user login/authentication (SSO/SSL/TLS/MFA), modern web UI, GraphQL APIs, and a microservices/lambda style. We  designed and develop the software as a low-cost, scalable, available, distributed, robust, and secure app in the AWS cloud.
